gs://quillio_audio_files/longconversation_1.flac: I'm having a conversation with myself for development purposes
gs://quillio_audio_files/longconversation_2.flac: wow you're so cool dude
gs://quillio_audio_files/longconversation_1.flac:  I'm writing an algorithm to take several transcripts and merge them together all into one based on time
gs://quillio_audio_files/longconversation_2.flac:  how are you doing that
gs://quillio_audio_files/longconversation_2.flac:  what are you using
gs://quillio_audio_files/longconversation_1.flac:  I'm doing this by taking several audio files transcribing them using the Google speech to text API and then I am using a merge sort algorithm to merge them together based on the time that each trunk starts
gs://quillio_audio_files/longconversation_2.flac:  that's really cool what else other kind of cool stuff for you doing
gs://quillio_audio_files/longconversation_1.flac:  hopefully we will do very well in our Sprinter View today
gs://quillio_audio_files/longconversation_2.flac:  yes I understand but that's not the question I asked mostly because I forgot what you said earlier
